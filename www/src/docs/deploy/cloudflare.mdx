# Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

JStack can be deployed to Cloudflare Workers, providing a globally distributed, serverless runtime for your API. This guide will walk you through the deployment process.

---

## Prerequisites

1. Install the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/)

   ```bash Terminal
   npm install wrangler@latest -g
   ```

2. Make sure you have an account at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)

---

## Deployment Steps

1. Deploy your backend to Cloudflare Workers using `wrangler deploy`. Enter the path to your `appRouter` file, by default this is:

   ```bash Terminal
   wrangler deploy src/server/index.ts
   ```

   The console output will look like this:

   <Frame>
     <Image src="/cf-deployment-url.png" alt="Deploy JStack to Cloudflare Workers" />
   </Frame>

2. Add the deployment URL to the client:

   ```ts lib/client.ts {5,8-16}
   import type { AppRouter } from "@/server"
   import { createClient } from "jstack"

   export const client = createClient<AppRouter>({
     baseUrl: `${getBaseUrl()}/api`,
   })

   function getBaseUrl() {
     // ðŸ‘‡ In production, use the production worker
     if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
       return "https://<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>.workers.dev"
     }

     // ðŸ‘‡ Locally, use wrangler backend
     return `http://localhost:8080`
   }
   ```

---

## Environment Variables

Make sure your Worker has the necessary environment variables configured. Either enter [one at a time](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/) or [update them in bulk](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#secretbulk):

```bash Terminal
wrangler secret put <KEY>
```

---

## Production Deployment

When you deploy your front-end application:

- Deploy to your preferred hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- After adding the deployment URL to your `lib/client.ts` file, your frontend will automatically connect to your Worker

---

## Common Problems

### CORS Configuration

If you are experiencing CORS problems, make sure your Worker is configured correctly:

```ts server/index.ts {8}
import { InferRouterInputs, InferRouterOutputs } from "jstack"
import { postRouter } from "./routers/post-router"
import { j } from "./jstack"

const api = j
  .router()
  .basePath("/api")
  .use(j.defaults.cors)
  .onError(j.defaults.errorHandler)

const appRouter = j.mergeRouters(api, {
  post: postRouter,
})

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter

export default appRouter
```

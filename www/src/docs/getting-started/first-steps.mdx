# First Steps

JStack makes it easy to build **performant, reliable Next.js applications**. You can start a new project in one of two ways:

- Using the CLI (recommended)
- Manual Setup

Especially if you use the CLI (which does all the setup automatically), this guide will help you understand key components of your new (and hopefully favorite ðŸ¤ž) Next.js & TypeScript tech stack.

---

## Quickstart        

The quickest way to get started is with the CLI:

```bash Terminal
npx create-jstack-app@latest
```

**That's it!** ðŸŽ‰ The CLI creates a brand new project following best practices and modern Next.js patterns. I recommend reading on to understand each part of JStack.

## 1. File Structure

Let's explore the main building blocks of JStack. I recommend the following file structure for your Next.js application:

```plaintext JStack File Structure
app/
  â””â”€â”€ server/
      â”œâ”€â”€ jstack.ts        # Initialize JStack
      â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts         # Main appRouter
      â””â”€â”€ routers/         # Router directory
          â”œâ”€â”€ user-router.ts
          â”œâ”€â”€ post-router.ts
          â””â”€â”€ ...
```

---

## 2. Initialize JStack

This file is the point where we initialize JStack. Optionally, you can specify your environment variable type here, which makes it **type-safe across your application**.

```ts server/jstack.ts {1,7}
import { jstack } from "jstack"

interface Env {
  Bindings: { DATABASE_URL: string }
}

export const j = jstack.init<Env>()

/**
 * Public (unauthenticated) procedures
 * This is the base part you use to create new procedures.
 */
export const publicProcedure = j.procedure
```

This file is where we create [Procedures](/docs/backend/procedures) and [Middleware](/docs/backend/middleware).

---

## 3. The App Router ðŸ§ 

The core of JStack is the `appRouter` - it's the entry point to your Next.js backend and manages all your API routes:

```ts app/server/index.ts
import { j } from "./jstack"

/**
 * This is your base API.
 * Here, you can handle errors, not-found responses, cors and more.
 */
const api = j
  .router()
  .basePath("/api")
  .use(j.defaults.cors)
  .onError(j.defaults.errorHandler)

/**
 * This is the main router for your server.
 * All routers in /server/routers should be added here manually.
 */
const appRouter = j.mergeRouters(api, {
  // ...
})

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter

export default appRouter
```

When a new HTTP request comes in to your server, the `appRouter` knows where to route the request.

## 4. Routers

Routers help you group related features. For example, you might have:

- `userRouter` for user related operations
- `paymentRouter` for all payment related operations
- `postRouter` for blog post operations

This is what a basic router looks like:

```ts server/routers/post-router.ts
import { j, publicProcedure } from "../jstack"

export const postRouter = j.router({
  recent: publicProcedure.query(({ c }) => {
    return c.json({ title: "first post" })
  }),
})
```

In this example:

- `postRouter` is the name of your [router](/docs/backend/routers)
- `recent` is the name of your [procedure](/docs/backend/procedures)
- The function gets a context object (`c`) with helpful utilities
- We return a mocked post using `c.json()`

---

## 5. Connecting a Router

Let's connect our new router to make it available for API requests:

```ts server/index.ts {2, 11}
import { j } from "./jstack"
import { postRouter } from "./routers/post-router"

const api = j
  .router()
  .basePath("/api")
  .use(j.defaults.cors)
  .onError(j.defaults.errorHandler)

const appRouter = j.mergeRouters(api, {
  post: postRouter,
})

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter
export default appRouter
```

---

## 6. API Setup

To handle all incoming requests with our `appRouter`, create a [catch-all API route](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments):

```ts app/api/[[...route]]/route.ts
import appRouter from "@/server"
import { handle } from "hono/vercel"

export const GET = handle(appRouter.handler)
export const POST = handle(appRouter.handler)
```

**That's it!** ðŸŽ‰

You can now send API requests to `http://localhost:3000/api/post/recent`. This path is made up of three different parts:

- base path (`/api`)
- Router name (`post`)
- Procedure name (`recent`)
